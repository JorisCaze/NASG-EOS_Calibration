### General remarks

1. Compilation & Run

	The compilation is done with a Makefile. Under Unix systems it reads :

	```sh
	$ make 
	```

	To run the calibration tool you just need to type the following :
	```sh
	$ ./exe
	```

	If you want to delete all `.o` files from the compilation you can run :
	```sh
	$ make clean
	```

	In case you want to remove the executable `exe`: 
	```sh
	$ make mrproper
	```

	To delete all the result files you can do :
	```sh
	$ make cleanres
	```
